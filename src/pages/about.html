      <p class="cs-text">
        BE BETTER BSBL is more than a baseball apparel brand—it's a mentality. Founded by Jake Fine, 
        a blue-collar RV worker and lifelong baseball fan, the brand was built on one belief: you can 
        always be better, on the field and in life.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        What started in my basement as an idea to create motivational apparel has evolved into something 
        much bigger: a movement built around baseball culture, youth development, and the relentless 
        pursuit of being better every single day. Every piece of apparel carries more than a logo—it's 
        a reminder to dig deeper, play with pride, and live the Be Better mentality.
